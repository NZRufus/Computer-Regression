# Computer-Regression #

## Aims and Objectives ##
Looking to investigate the effects of polynomial, lasso and ridge regression on linear regression model for prediction computer performance based upon various parameters.

## Methods ##
This was using different regression models such as lasso, ridge and polynomial as well as the logistical regression. 

## Results ##
These each showed similar regression scores in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE) except for lasso that had a slightly higher RMSE compared to others. It was a useful project for showing the effects of adjusting hyperparameters on RMSE as well as using the Pipeline function.
